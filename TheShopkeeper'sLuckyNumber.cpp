🧮 Question 2: The Shopkeeper’s Lucky Number

Problem Story:
A shopkeeper named Ramesh has a lucky number. He believes that if the number is even, he will have a lucky day, and if it is odd, he will have to work harder. He also wants to check if the number is divisible by 5, as that brings him extra luck!
Can you help Ramesh write a program to check his number?
Task:
Write a program that takes an integer as input and:

Checks whether it is even or odd.

Checks whether it is divisible by 5 or not.

Input Format:
The first line contains one integer — the lucky number.

Output Format:
Print two lines:
First line: "Even Number" or "Odd Number"
Second line: "Divisible by 5" or "Not Divisible by 5"
Example 1:
Input: 25
Output:
Odd Number
Divisible by 5

Example 2:
Input: 12
Output:
Even Number
Not Divisible by 5



#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter the lucky number: ";
    cin >> n;

    // Check even or odd
    if (n % 2 == 0)
        cout << "Even Number" << endl;
    else
        cout << "Odd Number" << endl;

    // Check divisibility by 5
    if (n % 5 == 0)
        cout << "Divisible by 5" << endl;
    else
        cout << "Not Divisible by 5" << endl;

    system("pause");  // For Dev-C++ to keep output window open
    return 0;
}
